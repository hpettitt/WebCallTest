# 🔧 VAPI Webhook Issue - SOLVED!

## ❌ The Problem
**VAPI wasn't sending transcript data because no webhook URL was configured.**

Your VAPI configuration was missing the crucial `serverUrl` parameter that tells VAPI where to send transcript and call completion events.

## ✅ The Solution

### Fixed in `interview.html`:
```javascript
const vapiConfig = {
  apiKey: vapiKey,
  assistant: vapiAssistantId,
  // ✅ ADDED: Webhook URL for transcript/call events
  serverUrl: "https://nbhugh.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/vapi-call-completed",
  config: { 
    // ... rest of config
  }
};
```

## 🔍 What This Fixes

### Before (Broken):
- ❌ VAPI had no webhook URL configured
- ❌ Transcript events had nowhere to go
- ❌ n8n webhook received 0 requests from VAPI
- ❌ 404 errors because VAPI wasn't even trying to send data

### After (Fixed):
- ✅ VAPI knows to send events to: `https://nbhugh.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/vapi-call-completed`
- ✅ Transcript events will be sent as POST requests
- ✅ Call completion events will include full transcript
- ✅ n8n webhook will receive proper data from VAPI

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Test the updated interview.html**:
   - Open the interview page
   - Check browser console for: `🔗 Webhook URL configured: https://nbhugh.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/vapi-call-completed`
   - Make a test call

2. **Monitor n8n executions**:
   - Check n8n workflow executions
   - Look for incoming POST requests with transcript data
   - Verify the debug node logs show VAPI event data

3. **Check VAPI logs**:
   - Should now show successful webhook posts (200 responses)
   - Should include transcript content in the payload

## 🎯 Expected Results

After making a call, you should see:

### In Browser Console:
```
🔗 Webhook URL configured: https://nbhugh.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/vapi-call-completed
🎯 VAPI will send transcript events to n8n webhook
```

### In n8n Execution Logs:
```
=== VAPI WEBHOOK DATA RECEIVED ===
Full payload: {
  "type": "transcript",
  "message": {
    "transcript": "Hello, is this John Smith? Yes, this is John...",
    "call": {
      "id": "call_123",
      "metadata": {
        "candidateName": "John Smith"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### In VAPI Dashboard Logs:
```
✅ POST https://nbhugh.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/vapi-call-completed - 200 OK
```

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

1. **Check VAPI Assistant Settings** in dashboard:
   - Ensure transcription is enabled
   - Verify webhook URL is saved properly
   - Check event types are selected (transcript, call-ended)

2. **Verify n8n Webhook**:
   - Workflow must be active
   - Must accept POST requests
   - Check endpoint URL is correct

3. **Test Manually**:
   - Use the webhook-test-tool.html to send test POST requests
   - Verify n8n receives and processes the test data

The core issue was simply that **VAPI didn't know where to send the data**. Now it does! 🎉
